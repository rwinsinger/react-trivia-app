Create a trivia game using the API found at https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

The game should do the following:
- Ask the player a trivia question and present the possible answers
- Tell the user if they get an answer right or wrong
- Ask multiple questions per game
- A final score that shows once all the questions are answered
- Have a way to play again (without refreshing!)
